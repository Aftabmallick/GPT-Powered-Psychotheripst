## Description:
GPT-Powered-Psychotherapist is a project that leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model to simulate conversations with users, acting as a virtual psychotherapist. This project aims to provide a platform where users can engage in therapeutic conversations with an AI-powered entity. It accepts both voice and text inputs and provides responses in both voice and text formats, enhancing the user experience.
